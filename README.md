## Getting Started

To get started with the kickZone API, you will need to obtain an API key by registering on our [developer portal](https://developer.kickzone.com). Once you have your API key, include it in the `Authorization` header of your requests.

## Authentication

All endpoints require authentication via an API key. Include the following header in your requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. Common status codes include:

- `200 OK` - The request was successful.
- `400 Bad Request` - The request was invalid or cannot be served.
- `401 Unauthorized` - Authentication failed or user does not have permissions.
- `404 Not Found` - The requested resource could not be found.
- `500 Internal Server Error` - An error occurred on the server.

## Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage, the API enforces rate limits. Each API key is allowed a certain number of requests per minute. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
